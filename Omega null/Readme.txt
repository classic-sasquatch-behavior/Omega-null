Q: what is this project?
A: This is Ω(0), it is a domain specific language (DSL) for ontological programming. This project is very much a work in progress. In fact, this readme is a work in progress as well.

Q: what is an ontological programming language?
A: Ontological programming is a paradigm opposed to Teleological programming. Ontology means "knowledge of being". Here, teleology means "knowledge of process".
Certain programming constructs are more or less ontological than others. 

Q: what is the premise of Omega Null?
A: Omega Null is predicated on the idea that work structures are always able to be abstracted to spatial terms. This allows problems to have an immanent spatial character,
which is easy to visualize. Being designed as a wrapper for OpenCL, Omega Null will be able to control parallel, serial and asynchronous devices in a heterogenous cluster.
Reducing these paradigms into common spatial terms makes it easy to integrate them together in one program. The author therefore has the freedom to focus purely on the 
Structure of the problem, rather than its exact implimentation. 

Q: what languages does Omega Null take after?
A: It is designed as a library/precompiler to be used with c++. In actuality, it Is OpenCL code, in the sense that Omega Null is translated directly into OpenCL code. 
Aesthetically, it mimics a description language like XML or HTML, as well as HDLs (Verilog in particular).
